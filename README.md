# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This is an interactive **Heart Disease Prediction Web App** built using **Streamlit** and **Machine Learning**. The model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters.


## 🚀 Features

* User-friendly **web interface** built with **Streamlit**
* Inputs for all essential heart disease indicators (age, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.)
* Model predicts **risk of heart disease** instantly
* **Mobile-friendly** and easy to share via URL
* Built-in model trained using **Logistic Regression** from the UCI Heart Disease dataset
